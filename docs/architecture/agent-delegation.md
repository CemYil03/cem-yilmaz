# Agent Delegation

The personal assistant at `/workspace/assistant` is the single voice for every workspace domain — projects, tasks, media, future calendar /
notes / fitness / finances / medical. Landing every domain tool on the one `agentPersonalAssistant` factory does not scale: the system
prompt grows unmanageable, and tool-selection accuracy decays past ~10–15 tools. Instead, the orchestrator stays thin and hands each domain
off to a focused sub-agent.

This doc covers the pattern. The sub-agents built on it are `agentPersonalAssistantProjects` (see
[features/workspace-projects.md](../features/workspace-projects.md)) and `agentPersonalAssistantMedia` (see
[features/workspace-media.md](../features/workspace-media.md)) — both wired identically.

## Decision

**The orchestrator is a router with one `delegateTo<Domain>` tool per focus area.** Each delegate tool's `execute` builds the matching
domain sub-agent in-process, calls `agent.generate({ messages })` with the user's brief as a single user message, and returns a structured
summary plus a mutation log. The orchestrator narrates the result back to the user.

The domain sub-agent runs **synchronously inside the orchestrator's tool turn** — same process, same database connection, same Node event
loop. There is no queue, no separate session, no extra HTTP hop.

### Why in-process and not a sibling factory

The two existing chat agents (`agentVisitorAboutCem`, `agentPersonalAssistant`) sit at the same level: dispatched by access path, each with
its own `onStepEnd` plumbing, each persisting chat-message rows. Adding more siblings means every domain agent has to manage that plumbing
too, and every cross-domain turn requires multiple top-level dispatches stitched together by the client. In-process delegation keeps the
user-visible chat at a single turn even when several domains are touched, and the sub-agents stay small because they own no chat
persistence.

### What the sub-agent can and cannot do

- ✅ Read any data via its read tools and via inline snapshots in its system prompt.
- ✅ Mutate the DB via wrapped `commands/*.ts` — the same commands the GraphQL resolvers use, called directly. Authorization continues to
  flow through the resolver namespace at the call boundary (`AdminMutation` is `guardAdminMutation`-gated); inside that boundary every
  command runs with the same admin session.
- ✅ Run multiple tool calls in sequence — the `ToolLoopAgent` loop works the same way as on the orchestrator.
- ✅ Persist tool-call rows. The sub-agent now receives an `onStepEnd` from the delegate tool; every tool call lands in
  `chatMessagesToolCall` with `parentChatMessageId` pointing at the delegate row's id, and the transcript renders them indented under the
  parent card. See [Nested tool calls](#nested-tool-calls) below.
- ❌ Persist `assistantText` rows. The sub-agent's final text is the orchestrator's `toolResult` payload, not a chat-visible row —
  user-facing narration is the orchestrator's job.
- ❌ Ask the user for input mid-delegation. `promptUserForInput` would need to insert a `chatMessagesAssistantInputCollection` row, which
  requires `generationId` plumbing back into the orchestrator's turn-runner. Instead the sub-agent returns a `needsMoreInfo` JSON sentinel
  and the orchestrator owns the back-and-forth.

### Parallel fan-out (web search only)

`delegateToWebSearch` takes `briefs: string[]` and fans out one sub-agent per brief with `Promise.allSettled`. All sub-agent tool-call rows
FK to the single pre-written delegate row (flat under one parent — no new nesting depth in the transcript renderer), and the delegate's
`toolResult` carries a per-brief `{ brief, status, summary }` array plus an aggregated batch `status` of `completed` / `partial` / `failed`.

Web search is the only delegate that fans out. The sub-agent is stateless and provider-executed (Gemini owns the search round-trip), so N
concurrent instances are safe. `delegateToProjects` and `delegateToMedia` stay 1:1: they carry mutation logs and issue DB writes, and
running parallel copies of one domain sub-agent would race on the same tables and shared `ProjectsAgentMutationLog` closure. If a future
read-only domain sub-agent shows up (pure lookups, no writes, no shared log), the fan-out shape can be reused; anything with a mutation log
stays 1:1.

### Mutation log

Each mutation tool the sub-agent calls pushes onto a closure-shared `ProjectsAgentMutationLog` — a plain `MutationRecord[]` allocated fresh
inside the delegate tool's `execute`. After `agent.generate(...)` resolves, the delegate tool returns the log alongside the sub-agent's
final-text summary:

```ts
{ status: 'completed', summary: '...', mutations: [{ kind: 'projectCreate', id: '...', title: '...' }, ...] }
```

This gives the orchestrator concrete facts to narrate ("Created project X and added three tasks") without re-querying. The log is also the
only artifact in the chat transcript that reflects what the sub-agent actually changed — debug it from there.

### The `needsMoreInfo`, `noOp`, and `failed` sentinels

When the brief is underspecified or out of domain, the sub-agent emits **only** a JSON object as its final text:

```json
{ "status": "needsMoreInfo", "missingFields": ["title", "projectId"], "summary": "..." }
{ "status": "noOp",          "missingFields": [],                     "summary": "..." }
```

The delegate tool's `execute` parses these and returns them to the orchestrator. The orchestrator's system prompt instructs it to:

- on `needsMoreInfo`, call its own `promptUserForInput` with slots matching `missingFields`, then re-delegate with the brief enriched;
- on `noOp`, fall back to a plain conversational reply or another tool.

The parser accepts a bare object or a fenced ` ```json ` block defensively — Gemini occasionally wraps things even when told not to.

There is a third terminal status, **`failed`**, that the sub-agent never emits itself — the delegate tool's `execute` synthesizes it. The
sub-agent run (the `agent.generate` call inside `toolDelegateToProjects.execute`) is wrapped in a `try/catch`; any throw — provider error,
schema-decode error, command exception — is caught there, logged via `serverRuntime.log.error`, and turned into
`{ status: 'failed', summary: '<one-line error message>', mutations: [...any writes that landed before the throw] }`. The orchestrator's
system prompt instructs it to narrate the failure verbatim and **not** to confabulate softer phrasings ("the tool is unreachable") or
silently retry. Without this catch the AI SDK wraps the exception as an inert `tool-error` content part on the next step — the orchestrator
sees only the error envelope, no log entry exists at the delegate layer, and the model invents an apology. The catch closes that gap; the
same gap is also covered defensively by `chatPersistStep`'s Phase A pass over `tool-error` parts (see
[Server-side error surfacing](#server-side-error-surfacing) below).

### Step budget

The sub-agent caps at `isStepCount(10)`. The orchestrator caps at `isStepCount(8)`, with `hasToolCall('promptUserForInput')` as the
hand-back-to-user signal. A single user message can therefore consume up to ~16 LLM steps if the orchestrator delegates once, gets
`needsMoreInfo`, asks the user, gets a reply, and re-delegates. Within one delegation the sub-agent has room for a list call + 2–3
mutations + final text without running into the ceiling.

### Nested tool calls

The orchestrator's `delegateToProjects` row lands in the transcript as a normal `chatMessagesToolCall`, but the calls the sub-agent makes
inside that delegation are **also persisted** — each child row carries `parentChatMessageId = <delegate row id>` on the spine, and the
transcript renderer (`partitionByParent` in `src/web/chat/chatTranscript.ts`) filters child rows out of the top-level list and hands them to
the parent's `<ChatMessageToolCall>` view, which renders them in an indented block below its own pill.

What this means concretely:

- The user sees `Called delegateToProjects` followed by `Called projectsList`, `Called projectUpsert`, `Called taskUpsert`,
  `Called projectActivityUpsert`, `Called projectLinkUpsert`, `Called projectFileCreate` … indented under the parent — an honest record of
  which DB writes happened, not a single opaque pill.
- The `delegateToProjects` row's `toolResult` still carries the structured `{ status, summary, mutations }` payload the orchestrator uses
  for its narration. That payload is what the LLM sees on replay; the indented child rows are user-facing additional context.
- `toModelMessages` does NOT look at `parentChatMessageId`. Each child is replayed as an ordinary `tool-call`/`tool-result` pair, so the
  AI-SDK contract stays intact and the LLM gets one extra source of context (it can read what the sub-agent actually did).

The persistence flow is asymmetric because of FK ordering. The orchestrator's `onStepEnd` only fires after a tool's `execute` returns, so
the parent row would be written **after** the children — making the children's FK invalid at insert time. To work around this, the delegate
tool pre-writes its own `chatMessagesToolCall` row up front (`toolResult: null`) inside `execute`, adds its `toolCallId` to a shared
`preWrittenToolCallIds` set so the orchestrator's outer `onStepEnd` skips it, runs the sub-agent (whose own `onStepEnd` is bound to
`chatPersistStep` with `parentChatMessageId` set), then updates the delegate row with the final `toolResult` + `resultedAt` and republishes
a fresh `ChatUpdateMessageAppended` so the UI swaps in the complete card.

The shared persistence helper is `chatPersistStep` in `src/server/commands/chatAssistantTurnRun.ts`. Both the orchestrator's `onStepEnd` and
the sub-agent's `onStepEnd` call it with different `parentChatMessageId` (null vs. the delegate row's id). Adding a second delegating tool
means another `tool<Domain>Delegate.ts` file that mirrors `toolDelegateToProjects` — same pre-write pattern, same shared
`preWrittenToolCallIds` set on `AgentChatOptions`. No new persistence code.

### Deep links

The orchestrator's system prompt (`BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `src/server/agents/agentPersonalAssistant.ts`) carries a route-map block that
instructs the model to format every project / inbox row / task / visitor chat it mentions as a markdown link to the matching workspace page
with a `?focus=<id>` search param. `<AssistantMarkdown>` (the streamdown wrapper) renders these as clickable anchors. The destination pages
read `focus` from their `validateSearch` schema and scroll-into-view + flash the matching DOM element (any `<li data-row-id="...">`) for
~1500ms before dropping the param via a replace-navigate so a refresh doesn't re-flash. The flash animation is `@keyframes focus-flash` in
`src/styles.css`, respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`.

The orchestrator gets the ids it needs from the `mutations` array returned by every `delegateToProjects` call (each entry is
`{ kind, id, title }`); the sub-agent doesn't bother emitting links itself because its `summary` is consumed by the orchestrator, not the
user. Routes that wire this today: `/workspace/projects` (`?tab=…&focus=<projectId | projectRequestId | taskId>`) and the visitor-chats
review page (`?chatId=<chatId>`). Future routes hook in by adding `focus` to their search schema and the same `useEffect` shape.

## Consequences

- **One file per sub-agent, one file per tool.** The convention is `src/server/agents/agentPersonalAssistant<Domain>.ts` for the sub-agent,
  one `src/server/agents/tool<Domain><Action>.ts` per tool. Top-level under `agents/` — no subfolder yet. Matches the visitor-agent shape.
- **Tools are thin wrappers around existing `commands/`+`queries/`.** CQRS already gave us single-purpose units. A tool file is mostly the
  Zod input schema, the closure-bound dependencies (`serverRuntime`, `session`, optional `mutations`), and 5–10 lines of `execute` that maps
  to the command's args shape and pushes onto the mutation log on success.
- <a id="tool-input-schemas"></a>**The default input schema is the generated `GqlS<X>InputSchema()` from
  `src/server/graphql/generated.ts`.** Same shape the resolver validates, no hand-built duplicate to drift out of sync as the SDL evolves.
  `typescript-validation-schema` (see [`codegen.ts`](../../codegen.ts) and [api-layer.md](./api-layer.md#code-generation)) emits both the
  object-schema factories (`GqlS<Input>Schema()`) and the enum schemas (`GqlS<Enum>Schema`) exactly for this consumer. Every mutation tool
  whose underlying command has a GraphQL input type — `toolProjectLinkUpsert`, `toolMediaChannelUpsert`, `toolMedicalRecordFileAttach`, and
  the four travel batch-upsert tools (which wrap the generated row schema in a single-key `z.object({ <entities>: z.array(...) })`) —
  imports its generated schema and uses it verbatim (with a `rawInput as GqlS<X>` cast to recover TS inference from the codegen's
  `Properties<T>` phantom; the runtime schema still validates against the type). Field-level explanations travel via the SDL's own field
  descriptions — `withDescriptions: true` on the codegen plumbs them into the generated Zod schemas — so the SDL stays the single source of
  truth for both the wire format and the field-level teaching the LLM sees.
- **Prefer batch shapes (`entitiesAction`) over singulars.** One `tripDaysUpsert` (accepting `[TripDayInput!]!`) beats N `tripDayUpsert`
  calls: fewer agent steps against `isStepCount(10)`, one transaction on the server, one `userUpdates` publish per batch. Every entity write
  on the travel domain uses this shape (`tripsUpsert`, `tripDaysUpsert`, `tripActivitiesUpsert`, `tripPackingItemsUpsert`, plus the matching
  deletes taking `[ID!]!`). Corresponding mutations return `MutationResult { success, referenceIds }` — never the hydrated entity — because
  the seed-and-subscribe posture over `userUpdates` already delivers the new state; a second row-shape in the mutation result would just be
  a second source of truth to keep aligned. `referenceIds` echoes the id per input row (in input order) so the sub-agent can use them as
  parent ids for the next tool call without a follow-up read.
- **Exception: `DateTime` fields.** When the underlying SDL input carries a `DateTime` scalar, the tool falls back to a hand-built
  `z.object` that uses `z.string()` for those fields and calls `new Date(...)` in `execute`. `typescript-validation-schema` emits `DateTime`
  as `z.date()`, which has no clean JSON-Schema representation under Gemini's constrained decoding (`structuredOutputs: true`) and produces
  `MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL` on plain inputs. Tools currently in this state: `toolProjectUpsert`, `toolTaskUpsert`,
  `toolProjectActivityUpsert`, `toolMovieUpsert`, `toolMovieAddFromTmdb`, `toolMedicalAppointmentUpsert`, `toolMedicalRecordUpsert`. Each
  keeps a short header comment pointing back to this bullet. **Enum schemas** (`GqlS<X>EnumSchema`) are still reused in the hand-built shape
  so a future enum addition surfaces as a TS error rather than a runtime mismatch; do not redeclare enum tuples by hand. Field-name drift
  between the SDL input and the tool input is caught by the resolver call: every mutation tool's `execute` constructs the resolver `input`
  object explicitly (or passes the validated input verbatim when the command signature accepts the domain input directly), so a missing or
  renamed field is a TS error at the tool file.
- **Follow-up (not yet done):** DateTime-safety is the open thread — either the codegen emits `z.iso.datetime()` for `DateTime` behind a
  separate agent-facing output, or a runtime helper walks `z.date()` → string on the object schemas. Either would let the DateTime-carrying
  tools drop their hand-built duplicates too.
- <a id="tool-self-description"></a>**Tool self-description is authoritative.** A tool's `description` string plus its per-field
  `.describe(...)` calls are the ONLY place a tool is explained. System prompts NEVER list tools — no "You have N tools: - foo does X"
  catalog, no orchestrator-side "Capabilities" bullets that restate what each delegate is for, no "When to search" block that duplicates
  what `toolDelegateToWebSearch` already carries. The information belongs on one surface so a change to one doesn't silently diverge from
  the other; the LLM sees the tool description on every call anyway, so the duplication buys nothing but drift risk.

  What DOES stay in a system prompt: persona ("you are Cem's medical sub-agent"), style rules (concision, language matching), cross-tool
  workflow rules that span multiple tools (`agentPersonalAssistantMedia`'s "for 'I watched X' → `movieMarkWatched`; if not in library →
  `movieAddFromTmdb` first" workflow), agent-role behavior rules (the medical sub-agent's RED FLAGS block — that's a _don't-call-any-tool_
  rule), the `{ status: 'needsMoreInfo' | 'noOp' }` JSON sentinel contract (this is the sub-agent → orchestrator wire, not a tool behavior),
  delegate-result-envelope narration policy on the orchestrator (how to react to `needsMoreInfo` / `failed`), deep-link templates (narration
  policy for the ids delegates return), and inlined data snapshots.

  The canonical exemplar of a self-describing tool is `toolProjectActivityUpsert.ts`: a multi-sentence description that names when to reach
  for it, the cross-tool guidance ("work timer rows are NOT created here"), and per-field `.describe(...)` for every input. The anti-pattern
  is a `buildSystemPrompt` with a "You have nine tools: - `projectsList` — ... - `projectUpsert` — ..." block.

- **Sub-agent failure is caught at the delegate layer and surfaced as `status: 'failed'`.** `toolDelegateToProjects.execute` wraps
  `agent.generate` in a try/catch: any throw — provider call, schema-decode mismatch, mutation command exception — is logged via
  `serverRuntime.log.error` and returned as `{ status: 'failed', summary, mutations }`. The orchestrator's system prompt tells it to narrate
  the failure verbatim instead of inventing a softer phrasing. Without this catch the AI SDK quietly wraps the exception as an inert
  `tool-error` content part and no log entry exists at the delegate layer — every project-create failure used to look like "the tool is
  unreachable" with no server-side trace.

### Server-side error surfacing

`tool-error` content parts (the AI SDK's way of representing a tool whose `execute` threw) are surfaced in two places, both belt-and-braces:

- **Inside the delegate tool** — the try/catch around `agent.generate` logs the original throwable directly with full context. This is the
  primary path; the catch knows the throw came from this delegation and can attach the structured `failed` result to the pre-written
  delegate row before returning it.
- **Inside `chatPersistStep` (Phase A)** — any `tool-error` content part the orchestrator's `onStepEnd` sees still gets logged via
  `serverRuntime.log.error`. This catches the cases the delegate-layer catch cannot: a non-delegating tool that throws, a future tool with
  its own `execute`, or a `tool-error` synthesized by the SDK for reasons other than an `execute` throw. We do not write a dedicated chat
  row for the error — the matching tool-call row from Phase B already carries the error payload as its `toolResult` for the LLM. The Phase A
  pass exists solely to refuse to let a silent failure go without a log entry.
- **Shared scaffolding is one tiny module.** `src/server/agents/agentScaffolding.ts` exports `googleAgentProviderOptions` plus a
  `currentDateForAgent()` helper (today's date as a one-liner each system prompt embeds near the top so Gemini doesn't fall back to its
  training-cutoff date when reasoning about deadlines). Nothing else lives there per `multi-agent-chat.md`'s "tiny helper, not a base class"
  stance. System-prompt builders, stop conditions, and tool sets stay per-agent.
- **Sub-agent failure isolates to its turn.** See the **`status: 'failed'`** bullet above and
  [Server-side error surfacing](#server-side-error-surfacing). The orchestrator narrates the failure to the user; the chat is never broken.
- **Cross-domain chaining is the orchestrator's job.** When calendar / notes / fitness sub-agents ship, the orchestrator calls them in
  series within a single turn. Each delegate tool's result feeds the next one's brief through plain prompt context — no shared state
  channel.
