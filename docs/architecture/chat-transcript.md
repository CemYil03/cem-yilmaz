# Chat transcript

> **Presentation rules for every chat surface** — paddings, max-widths, scroll behaviour, copy/TTS row, composer states — live in
> [`docs/styles/chat.md`](../styles/chat.md). This doc is about the scroll primitive itself and how the surfaces plug into it.

## Context

Four surfaces render an admin, visitor, or interviewer transcript today:

- **Workspace assistant sidebar** — `src/web/chat/WorkspaceAssistantChatBody.tsx`, mounted in the shadcn Sidebar and in a mobile Sheet.
- **Workspace assistant deep-link route** — `/workspace/assistant/<chatId>` at `src/routes/{-$locale}/workspace/assistant.$chatId.tsx`.
- **Visitor "Ask me anything" sheet** — `src/web/chat/WebsiteVisitorAssistantChatSheet.tsx`, mounted once at the root layout.
- **Workspace compass interview** — `src/routes/{-$locale}/workspace/compass.tsx` (`InterviewView`), which uses the `MessageScroller`
  primitives directly (`src/web/chat/CompassInterviewTranscript.tsx`) rather than `ChatTranscript`, because a `CompassInterviewMessage`
  isn't part of the `ChatMessage` union and doesn't need the tool-call / approval / input-collection dispatch. Streaming rides a parallel
  `compassInterviewUpdates` subscription with a dedicated `useCompassInterviewLiveUpdates` hook — see
  [`docs/features/workspace-compass.md`](../features/workspace-compass.md).

Before this component existed each surface hand-rolled the same 40-line block: a scroll ref, a `useLayoutEffect` that pinned the container
to `scrollHeight` when a signature over `messages.length + streaming buffer lengths` changed, an `onScroll` handler that flipped an
`isAtBottom` state below a 64px threshold, and a `<button>` "jump to latest" pill parked at `absolute bottom-3 left-1/2`. It worked for the
happy path — the transcript stayed pinned while you were reading the bottom, and the pill appeared when you scrolled up — but every hard
case of streamed chat scroll was broken:

- **Auto-scroll interrupted the reader.** Someone half-way up the transcript would be yanked to the bottom whenever the AI streamed a chunk
  if their `isAtBottom` had bounced true for a frame (short scroll containers, small viewports).
- **New turns dropped in at the bottom.** A fresh user question and its streamed reply arrived _below_ everything visible, so the reader had
  to hunt for where the new turn started.
- **Saved conversations opened at the absolute bottom.** Bookmarking `/workspace/assistant/<chatId>` and returning to it dropped you at the
  end of the transcript, past the last user prompt, with no context about what the reply was answering.
- **Prepended history would jump the scroll.** Not a problem today (we don't paginate transcript history yet), but any future "load older
  messages" affordance would have to reimplement the scroll-preservation logic from scratch.

## Decision

Extract a shared `ChatTranscript` component at `src/web/chat/ChatTranscriptShared.tsx` (the "Shared" suffix keeps it distinct from the
neighbouring `chatTranscript.ts` helpers on case-insensitive filesystems). Delegate the scroll behaviour to shadcn's `MessageScroller`
primitive (`src/web/components/base/message-scroller.tsx`), which wraps `@shadcn/react/message-scroller` — a purpose-built chat-scroller
that models the "great streaming chat" behaviours documented at <https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/message-scroller>:

- **Follows only while the reader is at the live edge.** If they scroll away — or select text, use the keyboard, or open a link — the stream
  stops pulling them.
- **Anchors new turns near the top of the viewport.** A fresh reply grows into the screen instead of pushing everything up.
- **Opens saved transcripts at the last anchor.** `defaultScrollPosition="last-anchor"` lands the reader at the last meaningful turn
  (usually the last user message), not the absolute bottom.
- **Preserves position when older history is prepended.** Any future "load more" affordance gets this for free.
- **Announces new content out of view.** The "jump to latest" pill re-uses `MessageScrollerButton direction="end"` with the primitive's
  `data-active` state; the button animates in only when the user is scrolled away, and the transitions ship with the primitive.

Every persisted message row and every in-flight streaming buffer is wrapped in a `MessageScrollerItem` with `scrollAnchor`. That's how
`MessageScroller` knows which rows are candidates for the "last-anchor" restore and for anchoring new turns.

## Composition

```
MessageScrollerProvider (defaultScrollPosition="last-anchor", scrollEdgeThreshold=64)
└── MessageScroller
    ├── MessageScrollerViewport   (default: scroll-fade-b, scrollbar-thin, overflow-y-auto)
    │   └── MessageScrollerContent  (default: flex-col gap-8)
    │       ├── initial-fetching spinner (only if `initialFetching` and no messages)
    │       ├── date-grouped sections
    │       │   ├── <Marker variant="separator"> with the day label
    │       │   └── <MessageScrollerItem scrollAnchor> per top-level TranscriptMessage
    │       │       └── <ChatMessage />
    │       └── streaming section
    │           └── <MessageScrollerItem scrollAnchor> per in-flight buffer
    │               └── <AssistantMarkdown streaming />
    └── MessageScrollerButton direction="end"  ("Jump to latest" pill)
```

`ChatTranscript` is intentionally scoped to the scroll container. It does not own:

- **The message union.** `ChatMessage` (`src/web/components/chat-message/index.tsx`) still owns the dispatch to `ChatMessageUser`,
  `ChatMessageAssistantText`, `ChatMessageToolCall`, `ChatMessageToolApprovalRequest`, `ChatMessageToolApprovalResponse`, and
  `ChatMessageAssistantInputCollection`.
- **The mutations.** `onCollectionSubmit` and `onApprovalRespond` are injected by the caller. The workspace surfaces use the `admin.*`
  namespace (`WorkspaceChatInputCollectionRespond` / `WorkspaceChatToolApprovalRespond`); the visitor sheet uses the visitor-namespace
  equivalents. Same component, different `admin` / non-admin dispatch.
- **The composer.** Each surface parks its own `<ChatComposer />` (or `<VisitorChatComposer />` / `<WorkspaceChatComposer />`) below the
  transcript.

## shadcn primitives used

Adopted from the shadcn New York v4 registry, adapted to this repo's conventions (`../../utils/cn` import path, existing `Button` reused).
The utility CSS lives in `shadcn/tailwind.css`, imported at the top of `src/styles.css`.

## What was intentionally not adopted

- **`Bubble`.** Assistant markdown in this app is not bubbled — the assistant text renders flush in the row so long-form markdown and code
  blocks are unclipped. The current `Bubble({ tone: 'user' | 'assistant' })` in `src/web/components/chat-message/shared.tsx` covers only the
  user side and matches the site's brand-tinted rounded-2xl treatment; adopting shadcn's `Bubble` would re-frame assistant text and lose
  that.
- **`Message`.** shadcn's `Message` centralises avatar + alignment + header + footer. The chat surface here has no avatars, and the existing
  `MessageRow({ side: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system' })` handles a three-way split (the `system` side is where tool-call pills land).
  Adopting `Message` would either invent avatars we don't want or leave slots empty.
- **`Marker` for tool-call pills.** The tool-call and approval-response rows render as centred rounded pills with an args button and a
  timestamp — a distinct visual language from `Marker`'s full-width row with border/separator lines. Retaining the pill treatment keeps
  system rows visually distinct from date separators.

## Key files

- `src/web/chat/ChatTranscriptShared.tsx` — the shared transcript renderer.
- `src/web/components/base/message-scroller.tsx` — shadcn primitive wrapper.
- `src/web/components/base/marker.tsx` — shadcn primitive.
- `src/web/components/base/attachment.tsx` — shadcn primitive.
- `src/web/chat/chatTranscript.ts` — union helpers (`groupMessagesByDate`, `partitionByParent`, `findLatestCollectionId`,
  `findPendingApprovalIds`, `findUserInputByCollectionId`, `mergeTranscriptMessages`). Unchanged by the refactor.
- `src/styles.css` — imports `shadcn/tailwind.css` so the `shimmer` and `scroll-fade` utilities are available.
