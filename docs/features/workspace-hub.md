# Workspace Hub

The private side of cem-yilmaz.de is a personal workspace. Phase 1 ships the **navigation hub** — a single landing page that lists the focus
areas Cem actively works on and prominently hosts the personal-assistant composer. Per-area features land in later phases.

## User Behavior

- `/workspace` (DE) and `/en/workspace` (EN) render the hub: a slimmed-down workspace header (logo links home, a breadcrumb trail to the
  right shows where you are inside the workspace, and the assistant chat button sits on the right — language and theme selectors are
  intentionally absent on workspace surfaces), a small muted motivational quote (see "Hero quote" below), the personal-assistant composer
  directly under the quote, and a **bento-style focus-area grid** below that. The composer scrolls with the page — it is **not** pinned to
  the viewport bottom; on a typical desktop the composer is already on-screen at load, and pinning it overlapped the last row of focus cards
  behind a progressive blur, which read as "the input is parked on top of my last tile."
- Sending a message from the hub composer creates a new admin-scope chat and navigates to `/workspace/assistant?chatId=<id>`, where the rest
  of the conversation happens. The hub itself stays a hub — every visit lands on the empty composer again.
- The focus-area cards are split into two subgroups:
  - **Personal areas** (top): Software, Projects, Finances, Tax, Fitness, Medical, Movies & TV — the daily-use surfaces.
  - **Public site** (bottom, under a small muted "Öffentliche Website / Public site" heading): CV, Visitor chats. These manage what appears
    on the public `cem-yilmaz.de` (the CV editor writes the `Cv*` tables that feed `/cv` and `/about`; the visitor-chats surface is for
    reading what visitors have asked the public assistant). They sit at the bottom because they're touched rarely compared to the personal
    areas above.
  - Routes:
    - CV → `/workspace/cv`
    - Software → `/workspace/software`
    - Projects → `/workspace/projects`
    - Finances → `/workspace/finances`
    - Tax → `/workspace/tax`
    - Fitness → `/workspace/fitness`
    - Medical → `/workspace/medical`
    - Movies & TV → `/workspace/media`
    - Visitor chats → `/workspace/visitor-chats`
- Each focus-area page is a placeholder: the area name + icon, a one-line "this area is being built out" body, and a muted "Coming soon"
  line. No per-page back-link — the workspace header's breadcrumb trail is the way back to `/workspace`.
- The language switcher is hidden on workspace surfaces (the workspace is single-user private chrome; the locale toggle belongs to the
  public site). To switch locale, return to a public page via the logo.

## Hero quote

Above the focus-area grid sits a rotating motivational quote — replacing the static "Welcome back, Cem" greeting that used to live there. A
generic welcome was wallpaper; the quote is a quiet motivational beat at the top of the hub. It is **rendered small and muted on purpose**
(body-text size, italic, `text-muted-foreground`) — it is not the focus of the workspace; the assistant composer and the focus-area grid
are. The list lives in `src/web/content/workspaceQuotes.ts` as `{ de, en, attribution? }` triples (Cem's own lines + a handful of well-known
entrepreneurial / resilience quotes). Edited via PR, same pattern as `personalInfo.ts` and `portfolioProjects.ts`.

Selection is **deterministic per UTC day** via `workspaceQuotePick()` — `dayOfYear % quotes.length`. Two consequences:

- SSR and hydration agree without a `useEffect` flash on first paint.
- Navigating back to `/workspace` later in the same day shows the same line; the quote is decoration, not churn-content.

The visible element is a `<blockquote>`, not an `<h1>` — wrapping a quote in h1 reads oddly to screen readers and pins the document outline
to whatever line landed today. A visually-hidden `<h1>Workspace</h1>` keeps the page semantically identifiable for assistive tech without
putting that string into the visual hierarchy. The browser-tab title and `seoMeta` description are unchanged.

## Personal-assistant composer

The assistant composer sits **directly under** the hero quote, in normal page flow — not pinned to the bottom of the viewport. It's a small
wrapper around `<MessageComposer />` that submits into the workspace assistant chat provider (see [Workspace Chat](./chat-workspace.md)) via
`openWithMessage(text)`. On a typical desktop the quote + composer occupy the top half of the viewport, so the assistant is the first thing
the user sees and the most prominent affordance — the same priority the old sticky placement was trying to encode, just without the
side-effect of overlapping the focus-area cards. Removing the sticky composer also removed the `ProgressiveBlurBottom` field and the 256px
bottom padding `<main>` used to reserve; neither was carrying weight once the composer left the bottom of the viewport. The composer is
rendered with `autoFocus` so the textarea is the active element on landing — the user can start typing immediately without clicking.

Submitting the hub composer opens the **workspace assistant sheet** (the same sheet the floating launcher on every other workspace page
opens) and fires the first message into it. The conversation stays in the sheet across navigation between focus areas; clicking **"Open
full-screen"** in the sheet's header navigates to `/workspace/assistant?chatId=<id>` for a dedicated full-screen surface. See
[Workspace Chat](./chat-workspace.md) for the sheet, launcher, and full-screen jump-off behaviour.

## `/workspace/assistant`

The dedicated chat surface for the personal assistant. Same shape as the public visitor chat sheet: empty state with the composer, loaded
state with a header, the transcript, and the composer pinned to the bottom. The loaded transcript reads `Query.admin.chat(chatId)` so a
stolen chatId from the visitor namespace is rejected by `chatFindByScope`.

This route is the **bookmark-able** form of the same conversation that lives in the sheet. The sheet's "Open full-screen" button hands the
active `chatId` off to this route via a normal navigation; the sheet stays the in-context surface for short questions while doing other
workspace work, the route is for deep work where the chat IS the page. See [Workspace Chat](./chat-workspace.md).

The route is `noindex`, kept out of the sitemap, and unlinked from the public site — same posture as the rest of `/workspace/*`.

## Auth and visibility

The README and `AGENTS.md` describe `/workspace/*` as the **GitHub-OAuth-gated, Phase 2** surface. Phase 1 ships the navigation shell and
the personal-assistant composer; the OAuth gate has not been built yet. To keep the surface non-public until then:

- All workspace routes pass `noindex: true` to `seoMeta()`. Each page emits `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow">`, so search
  engines do not list them.
- None of the workspace paths are added to `SITEMAP_PATHS` in `src/web/seo/sitemapRoutes.ts`. The convention there is explicit: noindex /
  logged-in / transactional pages stay out of the sitemap.
- The public landing page (`/`) and the site footer **do not link** to `/workspace`. The hub is reachable only by typing the URL.
- `guardAdmin` (`src/server/guards/guardAdmin.ts`) and `guardAdminMutation` (`src/server/guards/guardAdminMutation.ts`) are **permissive in
  Phase 1** — they return the namespace shape rather than throwing. The split mirrors `guardUserMutation` so Phase 2 can layer different
  posture on writes (e.g. CSRF, narrower allowlist) without dragging the read path along. The permissive policy is intentional: the hub now
  needs the admin namespace to be reachable so Cem can use his own assistant. The combination of noindex + unlinked + URL-obscured keeps the
  surface effectively private until the OAuth gate lands. A `TODO(phase-2)` in each file points at the future allowlist check.

The README's "Open TODOs Before Public Launch" section calls out that the gate must wrap the whole `/workspace/*` tree before DNS goes live.

```

All page files follow the same shape as `src/routes/{-$locale}/index.tsx` and `src/routes/{-$locale}/datenschutz.tsx`:
`createFileRoute(...)` with a `head()` that returns `seoMeta(...)`, plus a component that reads `useLocale()` and renders the locale's copy.

### Workspace header

Every workspace surface inherits the same chrome: `<WorkspaceHeader />` is mounted once at `src/routes/{-$locale}/workspace.tsx` (the
layout) and renders above the `<Outlet />`. Pages render only their body content — no per-page `<Header />` invocations and no per-page
`← Workspace` back-links.

`WorkspaceHeader` is a thin wrapper around `<Header />` that:

- passes `chatVariant="workspace"` so the chat button opens the personal-assistant sheet,
- passes `hideSelectors` so the language and theme selectors don't render (workspace is private chrome; locale/theme belong to the public
  site),
- builds a breadcrumb trail from the current pathname against a centralized `WORKSPACE_TITLES` map (path-segment → `{ de, en }` label) in
  the same file.

Adding a new `/workspace/<segment>` route: add one entry to `WORKSPACE_TITLES` so the breadcrumb has a label. Everything else is already in
the layout — the page file itself just exports its component.

The `<Header />` primitive grew two props to support this: `breadcrumbs?: ReadonlyArray<Crumb>` (replaces the brand cluster with
`logo + trail`; only the logo is a link, home) and `hideSelectors?: boolean`. The previous `brandLabel` variant is no longer used by any
workspace page but is kept on the primitive for any future surface that needs `logo + plain label` chrome.

### Hub layout

The hub reuses the same primitives the landing page does:

- `Card` / `CardContent` / `CardTitle` / `CardDescription` from `src/web/components/base/card.tsx`
- `useLocale()` from `src/web/hooks/useLocale.ts`
- `ChatComposer` from `src/web/chat/ChatComposer.tsx` (parameterized with the workspace mutation)
- `useChatLiveUpdates` from `src/web/chat/useChatLiveUpdates.tsx` (namespace-agnostic)

The header is **not** invoked by the hub itself — it comes from `<WorkspaceHeader />` mounted at the layout (see "Workspace header" above).
The hub's component body is only the assistant hero (quote + composer) and the focus-area grid.

A single `COPY` constant at the top of the file keys every visible string under `{ de, en }`. This follows the inline-bilingual-copy pattern
from `docs/architecture/i18n.md` — no translation library.

The cards are driven by two small `FocusArea[]` arrays — `PERSONAL_FOCUS_AREAS` and `PUBLIC_SITE_FOCUS_AREAS` (`{ key, to, icon }`) — and a
shared `<FocusCardGrid />` that renders one subgroup at uniform tile size with a parameterized `lg:grid-cols-*`. Adding a new focus area is
one entry to the right array plus one new file plus one new copy block.

**Two-subgroup layout.** The grid is split into a top "personal" subgroup and a bottom "public site" subgroup, separated by vertical spacing
and a small muted `<h2>` + one-line subtitle marking the boundary. Inside each subgroup every tile is the same size — the previous bento
with `primary` / `standard` / `wide` spans encoded a daily-vs-rare priority across one combined grid, but reading the layout as one flow
obscured that CV and Visitor chats are content-management surfaces for the public site rather than daily personal areas. Splitting them into
a labelled cluster at the bottom makes that grouping legible without relying on tile size as a proxy for it.

**Tile sizing.** Both subgroups use the same uniform grid: 1 column on `sm`, 2 on `md`, then 4 on `lg` for the personal subgroup (7 entries
→ 4 + 3 with a trailing gap on the second row) and 2 on `lg` for the public-site subgroup (2 entries side by side). The trailing gap is
intentional — adding a filler tile or shrinking to `lg:grid-cols-3` would just shift the awkwardness around. Card heights are uniform inside
a subgroup because every card has the same icon + title + one-line description layout.

**Card content.** Each card is icon + title on one row, a one-line description below, and an `ArrowUpRightIcon` tucked in the top-right
corner that brightens and translates on hover. The previous "Öffnen → / Open →" labelled-button row was redundant with the entire card being
a `<Link>`; removing it cut a row of vertical space per card without losing affordance — the cursor change on hover, the corner arrow, and
the card-wide hover state all still read as "this is clickable."

### Stub layout

Each focus-area stub has its own `COPY` constant (title, description, body, "coming soon") and a single `<main>` block: icon + h1 → body
paragraph → muted "Coming soon" line. They are intentionally tiny — the goal of Phase 1 is for the navigation to exist, not for the rooms to
be furnished. Stubs don't render their own header or back-link; the workspace header above the outlet provides both.

### Wiring `ChatComposer` to the admin namespace

`ChatComposer` accepts three optional props that turn it from a visitor-only widget into a namespace-agnostic one:

- `sendMutation` — the `chatMessageCreate` document to call. Defaults to the visitor `ChatMessageCreateDocument`. The hub and the workspace
  assistant route pass `WorkspaceChatMessageCreateDocument` instead.
- `extractResult` — pulls `{ chatId }` out of the mutation result. The visitor default reads `data.chatMessageCreate`; the workspace callers
  pass an extractor that reads `data.admin.chatMessageCreate`.
- `placeholder` — localized placeholder string. Defaults to `"Type a message…"`.

The visitor chat sheet on the landing page (`WebsiteVisitorAssistantChatSheet`) is unchanged — it doesn't pass any of these and gets the
visitor defaults.

### SEO

Every workspace route passes `noindex: true` to `seoMeta()`. The shared canonical URL and `hreflang` alternates still render correctly via
`webPageUrlGet()` so a directly-shared link resolves cleanly, but the page is not indexed and not in the sitemap. See
`docs/architecture/seo.md` for the underlying conventions.

## Adding a new focus area

1. Add a new entry to `COPY.areas` in `src/routes/{-$locale}/workspace/index.tsx` (DE + EN copy).
2. Add a new entry to either `PERSONAL_FOCUS_AREAS` (daily-use surfaces) or `PUBLIC_SITE_FOCUS_AREAS` (content that feeds the public site)
   in the same file (key, route path, icon). If you're adding a third subgroup, factor a new array + `<FocusCardGrid />` invocation in
   `FocusAreaGrid` and pick an appropriate `lg:grid-cols-*` for its width.
3. Create a new stub file under `src/routes/{-$locale}/workspace/` mirroring one of the existing stubs (`software.tsx`, etc.). Use the same
   `COPY` shape and `seoMeta({ ..., noindex: true })`. The stub does **not** render its own `<Header />` or back-link — both come from the
   layout.
4. Add the new path-segment to `WORKSPACE_TITLES` in `src/web/components/WorkspaceHeader.tsx` so the breadcrumb has a label.
5. Do **not** add the new path to `SITEMAP_PATHS` — workspace routes stay out of the sitemap until they are public.

## Open TODOs

- **Phase 2 — OAuth gate.** Wrap `/workspace/*` behind GitHub OAuth (env vars `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`,
  `WORKSPACE_GITHUB_LOGINS`). The README and `AGENTS.md` already document the env vars; the gate itself does not exist yet. `guardAdmin` and
  `guardAdminMutation` are the files that flip from permissive to allowlist-checked.
- **Phase 2+ — populate focus areas.** Each stub becomes a real surface (per-area notes, lists, integrations) once the gate is in.
- **Follow-up — extract `ChatTranscript`.** The transcript layout in `src/web/chat/WebsiteVisitorAssistantChatSheet.tsx` and
  `src/routes/{-$locale}/workspace/assistant.tsx` is duplicated. Once a third surface needs it, extract to a shared component under
  `src/web/chat/`.
